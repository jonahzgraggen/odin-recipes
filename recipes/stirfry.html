    <p>
        this dish is one of those weekly powerhouses. it's healthy, fast, and 
        tastes incredible. it takes  less than half an hour to put together,
        and it serves two people. my parents used to cook this for me growing 
        up, and it was one of my favourites back then. still is. i got my 
        girlfriend addicted to it, too.
