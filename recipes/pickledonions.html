        my taste in food is strongly biased towards acidity. if a meal isn't 
        properly acidic, it just can't hit the spot for me. pickled onions
        are a perfect ingredient to add acidity to any dish - pizza, tacos, 
        chili, really almost anything (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4HbmPu_M_4&ab_channel=EthanChlebowski">ethan 
        chlebowski</a> even puts them on peanut butter sandwiches!). they also add a bright
        colour to dishes that make them pop.
